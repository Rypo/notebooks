This report applies two contrasting but complementary approaches for valuing health damage caused by
main air pollutants — the value of statistical life (VSL) and the value of a life year (VOLY).

• The value of statistical life (VSL) — an estimate of damage costs based on how much people are willing
to pay for a reduction in their risk of dying from adverse health conditions;

• The value of a life year (VOLY) — an estimate of damage costs based upon the loss of life expectancy
(expressed as potential years of life lost, or YOLLs). This measure takes into account the age at which
deaths occur by giving greater weight to deaths at younger age and lower weight to deaths at older
age.
